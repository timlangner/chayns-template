## Development

1. Install all project dependencies with `npm`
2. Adjust your `project.json` file.
3. Start your webpack-dev-server for debugging your project with `npm start`

    > The webpack-dev-server is now running on your localhost on the port 8080. If the port is not available you can change it in the `webpack.config.js`.

    > `npm start` runs the server in HTTPS mode.

4. Enable eslint in your development environment. _(not necessary, but recommended)_
5. Implement the example Page to your [chayns® site][https://chayns.net].
    1. Go to configuration -> Pages
    2. Click `Add Page`
    3. Use external content
    4. Give the Page a name and type in the following URL : `https://localhost:8080`
    5. Click `add`
6. Start development.
